#  Windows Phone Silverlight to UWP mappings

This repository contains the mapping definitions and documentation for the **Mobilize.NET Silverlight Bridge for UWP** conversion tool, the tool allows developers to move its Windows Phone Silverlight 8 and 8.1 apps to the new **Universal Windows Platform (UWP)**, saving them a lot of effort and time by automating the main tasks required to have old apps running on the new Microsoft platform.
